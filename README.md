# JUnit-Testing
This is a project I completed on JUnit Testing

--How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I used JUnit testing while developing the code for this project. The goal was to create a series of objects and services that manipulate those objects for a fictional company. That company had constraints on the data that could be entered in each field. I made sure that I regularly checked requirements and ensured that my testing had 100% converage in order to deliver what was requested from the customer. 

--How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I spent time with the requirements so that I could gain a good understanding of the customers objectives and was mindful of them when writing the code. In each module I created a new part of the project and then reviewed them as a whole for the final submission. The goal here was to ensure I followed best pratices and incorporated feedback feedback from others who reviewed my code. I found that feedback especially valueble. 

--How do I approach designing software

This may see a little silly but I approach designing software like a puzzle or game. Especially with JUnit testing allowing me to have a scoreboard of sorts with my coverage. trying to make all the peices of the puzzle fit together and hit a high score of 100% coverage makes the tasks a lot more fun. I would try to write as many tests as possible and anticipate the logical branches of each and every function. Trying to get as close as possible to 100% coverage on the first coverage run was a fun challenge for myself. I would increimentally test units before to ensure that my code was solid before running coverage. No point in running coverage without ensuring that incremental testing took place. Once I was sure that everything worked as expected I thought about coverage.
